# Gordian Knot Database: Unraveling Fusion Protein Linkers
The Gordian Knot Database is the first of its kind, a meticulously curated repository designed to enhance our understanding of fusion protein linkers, pivotal in the genesis of cancerous tumors. This project encapsulates a vast array of data on linker sequences, shedding light on their structural and functional nuances within the realm of oncology.

# Project Overview
Fusion proteins, particularly their linker regions, play a crucial role in tumorigenesis, often serving as a hallmark of cancerous transformations. Our research delves deep into the intrinsic disorder of these linkers, unraveling their properties such as flexibility, hydrophilicity, and their role in protein viability and evasion from degradation pathways. Through this database, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future explorations into therapeutic targets, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment strategies.

# Database Highlights
Extensive Dataset: Over 7,455 fusion protein linkers, making it the largest dataset of its kind, aimed at facilitating groundbreaking research in oncogenic processes.
Advanced Analysis: Detailed examination of linker lengths, amino acid frequency, and propensity, providing insights into their structural and functional characteristics.
Interactive User Interface: Designed to allow easy access and navigability for researchers, enhancing the exploration of linker region traits.
Research Insights
Our findings underscore the significance of linker regions in fusion proteins, illustrating their larger average length compared to natural multi-domain proteins and highlighting the unique composition of amino acids that favor hydrophilic and often polar residues. These insights pave the way for a deeper understanding of the linkersâ€™ structural and functional roles in oncoproteins.
